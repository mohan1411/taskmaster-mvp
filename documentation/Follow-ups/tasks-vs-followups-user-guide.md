# Tasks vs Follow-ups: User Guide

## The Simple Difference

Think of it this way:

## When to Use What?

### Use Tasks For:

### Use Follow-ups For:
- ðŸ“§ Email responses you owe

- ðŸ“§ Maintaining conversations
- ðŸ“§ Relationship management
- ðŸ“§ Pending approvals
- ðŸ“§ Information requests

## Pro Tips

1. **Some emails need BOTH**:
   - Create tasks for the action items
   - Create a follow-up for the response

2. **Use follow-up key points**:
   - List specific questions to answer
   - Note important details to include
   - Track commitments to make

3. **Link related items**:
   - Connect tasks to their source email
   - Reference follow-ups in task descriptions
   - Keep context connected

4. **Set realistic due dates**:
   - Tasks: When the work must be completed
   - Follow-ups: When the response is expected

5. **Priority differences**:
   - Task priority = Work importance
   - Follow-up priority = Response urgency

## Remember:

- **Tasks** help you manage your workload
- **Follow-ups** help you manage your relationships
- **Together** they ensure nothing falls through the cracks

The key is to use the right tool for the right job!
