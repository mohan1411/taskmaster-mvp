Task Extraction from Email
Purpose: Identifies specific, actionable items within an email that need to be completed.
What it looks for:

Explicit action items ("Please review the document")
Implied tasks ("We need to finalize the budget")
Deadlines ("due by Friday")
Deliverables ("send me the report")
Requests for specific actions

Output: Creates actual task entries in your task management system with:

Task title
Description
Due date (if mentioned)
Priority level
Category (work, personal, urgent, etc.)

Example:

Email: "Please review the attached proposal and send me your feedback by Friday. Also, can you schedule a meeting with the client next week?"
Extracted tasks:

"Review proposal and send feedback" (Due: Friday)
"Schedule meeting with client" (Due: Next week)



Follow-up Detection
Purpose: Determines if the entire email conversation needs a response or continued attention.
What it looks for:

Questions that need answers
Requests for information
Ongoing conversations requiring replies
Commitments that need acknowledgment
Important relationships to maintain

Output: Creates a follow-up reminder with:

Reason for follow-up
Suggested response date
Key points to address
Contact information
Links to the original email

Example:

Email: "It was great meeting you at the conference. I'd love to discuss potential collaboration opportunities. When would be a good time to chat?"
Follow-up: "Respond to [Contact] about collaboration discussion" with key points: ["Schedule call", "Discuss collaboration opportunities"]

Key Differences

Scope:

Task extraction: Identifies multiple specific actions within an email
Follow-up: Treats the entire email/conversation as needing attention


Output Type:

Task extraction: Creates actionable tasks with specific deliverables
Follow-up: Creates reminders to respond or maintain communication


Timing:

Tasks: Can have specific deadlines mentioned in the email
Follow-ups: Usually suggests appropriate response timeframes based on context


Relationship:

Tasks: Focus on what YOU need to do
Follow-ups: Focus on maintaining communication with OTHERS


Completion:

Tasks: Completed when the specific action is done
Follow-ups: Completed when you've responded to or addressed the email



In your TaskMaster system, both features work together to ensure nothing falls through the cracks - whether it's specific action items (tasks) or maintaining important communications (follow-ups).
