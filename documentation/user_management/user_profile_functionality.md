| Profile Settings | ✅ Implemented | Settings tab for updating profile information |
| Forgot Password Page | ✅ Implemented | Form to request password reset link |
| Reset Password Page | ✅ Implemented | Form to set a new password using reset token |

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

1. **User Model** (`userModel.js`)
   - Stores user data including authentication details
   - Handles password hashing and verification
   - Includes reset token fields for password recovery

2. **User Controller** (`userController.js`)
   - Manages user registration, login, and profile operations
   - Handles password reset token generation and verification
   - Provides Google OAuth integration

3. **Authentication Middleware** (`authMiddleware.js`)
   - Validates JWT tokens for protected routes
   - Supports role-based access control

### Frontend Components

1. **Auth Context** (`AuthContext.js`)
   - Provides authentication state throughout the application
   - Handles login, registration, and profile update functions
   - Manages token storage and refreshing

2. **Login and Registration Pages**
   - Form validation using Formik and Yup
   - Appropriate error handling and user feedback

3. **Profile Settings Component**
   - Tab-based settings interface
   - Form for updating profile details
   - Password change functionality

4. **Password Recovery Flow**
   - Request password reset form
   - Token verification
   - Password reset form

## Authentication Flow

### Standard Login Flow

1. User enters email and password
2. Server validates credentials
3. If valid, server returns JWT access token and refresh token
4. Client stores tokens and includes access token in API requests
5. When access token expires, refresh token is used to get a new one

### Password Reset Flow

1. User requests password reset via email
2. Server generates reset token and sends email with reset link
3. User clicks link and is directed to reset password page
4. Reset token is verified on page load
5. User enters new password
6. Server validates token again and updates password

## Future Enhancements

### Planned for MVP+

| Feature | Priority | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Email Verification | High | Implementation of email verification flow |
| Profile Picture | Medium | Ability to upload and manage profile pictures |
| Google Login UI | Medium | Complete the Google OAuth login in frontend |

### Post-MVP Considerations

| Feature | Priority | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Two-Factor Authentication | Low | Add 2FA for enhanced security |
| Session Management | Low | View and manage active sessions |
| Account Deletion | Low | Allow users to delete their accounts |
| Advanced User Preferences | Low | Additional personalization options |

## Test Scenarios

### Registration Testing

1. Register with valid information -> Account created successfully
2. Register with existing email -> Error message displayed
3. Register with invalid data -> Form validation errors shown

### Login Testing

1. Login with valid credentials -> Successfully redirected to dashboard
2. Login with invalid credentials -> Error message displayed
3. Login with remember me -> Session persists after browser restart

### Profile Management Testing

1. Update profile information -> Changes saved successfully
2. Change password -> New password works for login
3. Invalid data entry -> Appropriate validation errors

### Password Reset Testing

1. Request reset for valid email -> Email sent confirmation
2. Request reset for invalid email -> Error message
3. Use expired/invalid reset token -> Error message
4. Reset with valid token -> Password updated successfully

## Technical Debt and Improvements

1. **Email Service Abstraction**
   - Current implementation directly uses nodemailer
   - Should create a service layer for better email handling

2. **Refresh Token Rotation**
   - Current implementation reuses refresh tokens
   - Should implement token rotation for better security

3. **Error Handling**
   - Improve consistency in error responses
   - Add more specific error codes

4. **Validation**
   - Centralize validation logic between frontend and backend
   - Consider using a shared validation schema

## Conclusion

The user profile functionality provides a solid foundation for the TaskMaster application. It includes all essential features required for an MVP, with several areas identified for future enhancement. The current implementation follows best practices for authentication and security, with proper separation of concerns between backend and frontend components.
