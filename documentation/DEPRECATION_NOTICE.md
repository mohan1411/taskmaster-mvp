# DEPRECATION NOTICE

## Documentation Migration in Progress

This directory is being deprecated in favor of the new documentation structure in the `/docs` directory.

## Why are we moving?

We're reorganizing our documentation to provide:
- A single source of truth for all project documentation
- Better organization of documentation by purpose and audience
- Easier navigation and discoverability of information
- Improved maintainability through consistent structure

## Where to find the documents?

All documentation is being migrated to the new structure in `/docs`:

- **Technical Documentation**: `/docs/architecture/technical/`
- **Development Guides**: `/docs/development/guides/`
- **API Documentation**: `/docs/development/api/`
- **Feature Documentation**:
  - Follow-ups: `/docs/features/follow_ups/`
  - Task Management: `/docs/features/task_management/`
  - Email Management: `/docs/features/email_management/`
- **User Guides**: `/docs/user/guides/`

## Documentation Index

For an overview of all available documentation, refer to `/docs/index.md`.

## Timeline

This directory will be maintained until all documentation has been successfully migrated.
After the migration is complete, this directory will be removed in a future update.

Please start using the new documentation structure for all new and updated documentation.
