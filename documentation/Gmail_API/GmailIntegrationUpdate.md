# Gmail API Integration Update

## Overview

The Gmail API integration has been completed for TaskMaster. This integration allows users to connect their Gmail accounts, sync emails, and extract tasks from email content.

## Features Implemented

- **Gmail Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 flow for secure connection to Gmail
- **Email Synchronization**: Fetch and sync emails from Gmail into TaskMaster
- **Task Extraction**: Extract tasks from email content using AI
- **Follow-up Detection**: Identify emails that need follow-up responses
- **Connection Management**: Connect, disconnect, and check connection status

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Components

- **GmailConnect.js**: UI component for connecting to Gmail
- **GmailCallback.js**: Handler for OAuth callback
- **EmailsPage.js**: Page for displaying and managing emails

### Backend Endpoints

- **GET /api/emails/auth-url**: Generate the Gmail OAuth URL
- **POST /api/emails/connect-gmail**: Connect to Gmail with authorization code
- **GET /api/emails/check-connection**: Check Gmail connection status
- **POST /api/emails/disconnect**: Disconnect from Gmail
- **POST /api/emails/sync**: Sync emails from Gmail
- **GET /api/emails**: Get synced emails with filtering options
- **GET /api/emails/:id**: Get a specific email with full content
- **POST /api/emails/:id/extract**: Extract tasks from an email
- **GET /api/emails/labels**: Get Gmail labels
- **GET /api/emails/analytics**: Get email analytics

## How to Use

### Connecting Gmail

1. Navigate to the Emails page in TaskMaster
2. Click on "Connect Gmail" button
3. Authorize TaskMaster in the Google OAuth consent screen
4. You'll be redirected back to TaskMaster with a successful connection

### Syncing Emails

1. Once connected, click "Sync Emails from Gmail"
2. TaskMaster will fetch your recent emails
3. Emails will be displayed in the email list

### Extracting Tasks

1. Find an email in the list that contains potential tasks
2. Click on the "Extract Tasks" icon
3. AI will analyze the email and suggest tasks
4. Review and save the extracted tasks

## Configuration

To configure the Gmail API integration:

1. Set up a Google Cloud Platform project
2. Enable the Gmail API
3. Configure the OAuth consent screen
4. Create OAuth 2.0 credentials
5. Add authorized redirect URIs

For detailed setup instructions, see the [Gmail API Setup Guide](./GmailAPISetup.md).

## Testing

To test the Gmail API integration:

```bash
cd backend
npm run test:gmail
```

This will run the Gmail API test script that validates your configuration and API access.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection Issues**: Ensure your Google Cloud project is properly configured with the Gmail API enabled and OAuth consent screen set up.
- **Authentication Errors**: Check that your redirect URIs match exactly in both your code and GCP settings.
- **Token Expiration**: If tokens expire, the system should automatically refresh them. If issues persist, try disconnecting and reconnecting your account.

## Security

- Access tokens and refresh tokens are securely stored in the database
- Only email metadata is stored persistently; full content is fetched on demand
- Minimum required scopes are requested for Gmail access

## Next Steps

- Add email filtering and searching capabilities
- Enhance the email UI with more detailed views
- Implement email threading for better conversation tracking
