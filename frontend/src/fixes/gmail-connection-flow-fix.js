/**
 * Fix for Gmail Connection Flow
 * 
 * This file contains fixes for two issues in TaskMaster:
 * 1. Empty email list after Gmail connection
 * 2. Child dialog appearing for Gmail connection instead of redirecting to main email page
 * 
 * The fixes have been applied to the following files:
 * 
 * 1. GmailCallback.js
 *    - Added auto-sync of emails after successful connection
 *    - Improved navigation to ensure immediate redirect to emails page
 * 
 * 2. App.js
 *    - Updated route for Gmail callback to ensure it works properly
 * 
 * 3. EmailsPage.js
 *    - Added auto-sync when emails are empty
 *    - Improved handling of connection states
 * 
 * 4. EmailList.js
 *    - Simplified follow-up label display
 * 
 * HOW TO TEST THE FIX:
 * 
 * 1. Restart your frontend application
 * 2. Disconnect Gmail if currently connected
 * 3. Click "Connect Gmail" button
 * 4. Complete the Google authentication
 * 5. You should be automatically redirected to the emails page
 * 6. Emails should automatically sync and display
 * 
 * If emails don't appear, try clicking the "Sync Emails from Gmail" button.
