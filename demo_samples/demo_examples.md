Don't forget to schedule a meeting with the development team for next Friday to discuss technical requirements. They mentioned they need at least 2 hours to go through everything.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Hello,

Thank you for the comprehensive proposal you sent last week. The team and I have had a chance to review it, and we're very impressed with your approach.

We're currently evaluating proposals from three vendors, and yours is definitely a strong contender. The AI integration component you've proposed is particularly interesting and aligns well with our strategic goals.

I need to discuss the budget allocation with our finance team, as the $150,000 investment requires board approval. We should have a decision by early next week, and I'll reach out to you with our feedback.

Could you clarify one thing about the timeline? You mentioned 6 months for completion - is there any flexibility if we need to expedite certain phases?

I'll be in touch soon with our decision.

Best regards,
Jennifer Martinez
CTO
TechCorp Industries

Date: May 25, 2025, 3:45 PM

Hi,

It was fantastic meeting with you today to discuss the potential partnership opportunity. I'm excited about the possibilities for collaboration between our companies.

The co-marketing approach you outlined makes a lot of sense, and I think there's real potential for mutual benefit here. The revenue-sharing model you proposed is interesting, though I'll need to run it by our finance team to see how it fits with our existing partnerships.

I'd like to set up a follow-up call next week to dive deeper into the technical integration requirements. My team will need to understand the API capabilities and data-sharing protocols.

Would you be available for a call next Tuesday or Wednesday? I'll send over some technical questions beforehand so we can make the most of our time.

I'm optimistic about moving this forward!

Best,
Robert Kim
VP of Partnerships
