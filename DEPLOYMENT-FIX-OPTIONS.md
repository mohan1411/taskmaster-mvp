# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Fix FizzTask.com Deployment

## Current Setup (WRONG)
- **Vercel**: Serving `/public` (static landing page)
- **Railway**: Serving backend API only
- **Result**: You see the React template because the React app isn't built anywhere!

## The Fix: 3 Options

### Option 1: Full App on Railway (RECOMMENDED)
Deploy everything to Railway - backend + built React app

### Option 2: Separate Services (Current setup, needs fix)
- Landing page on Vercel (landing.fizztask.com)
- Full app on Railway (fizztask.com or app.fizztask.com)

### Option 3: Vercel for Frontend, Railway for Backend
- React app on Vercel (fizztask.com)
- Backend API on Railway (api.fizztask.com)

## IMMEDIATE FIX: Option 1 (Deploy Full App to Railway)

### Step 1: Update Railway to serve the full app
The railway.toml and package.json updates I made earlier will:
- Build the React app during deployment
- Serve it from the backend

### Step 2: Point fizztask.com to Railway
1. Go to your domain registrar
2. Update DNS records:
   ```
   A record: @ â†’ [Railway IP]
   A record: www â†’ [Railway IP]
   ```
3. Remove Vercel connection from fizztask.com

### Step 3: Use Vercel for landing page only
1. In Vercel dashboard, remove fizztask.com
2. Add landing.fizztask.com instead
3. Update DNS: CNAME landing â†’ [vercel-url]

## IMMEDIATE FIX: Option 3 (Keep current setup but fix it)

### Step 1: Change Vercel to serve React app
1. Update vercel.json:
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "name": "fizztask-app",
  "outputDirectory": "frontend/build",
  "buildCommand": "cd frontend && npm install && npm run build",
  "env": {
    "REACT_APP_API_URL": "https://[your-railway-url].railway.app"
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Commit and push
```bash
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Configure Vercel to build React app instead of landing page"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Update in Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to Project Settings
2. Change Root Directory to: `./`
3. Change Output Directory to: `frontend/build`
4. Add environment variable:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL` = your Railway backend URL

## Which option do you want?

1. **Everything on Railway** (simplest)
2. **Fix Vercel to serve React app** (keep current setup)
3. **Move landing to subdomain** (landing.fizztask.com)
