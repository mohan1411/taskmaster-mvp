## üé¨ OPENING (0:00 - 0:20)

**[Scene: FizzTask Logo Animation]**

**Narration:**
"Are you drowning in emails, losing track of important tasks, and missing critical deadlines? 

What if AI could automatically turn your chaotic inbox into an organized, prioritized task list?

Welcome to FizzTask - where artificial intelligence meets productivity. Let me show you how FizzTask transforms the way you work."

---

## üìä SECTION 1: DASHBOARD (0:20 - 1:00)

**[Scene: Login and Dashboard Overview]**

**Narration:**
"As soon as you log into FizzTask, you're greeted with a powerful dashboard that gives you complete visibility of your workday.

Notice how we have:
- **8 active tasks** that need attention
- **2 tasks already in progress** 
- **10 unread emails** waiting to be processed
- **2 pending follow-ups** to keep relationships moving

The dashboard intelligently categorizes your tasks:
- **2 urgent items** that need immediate attention - including that overdue software license renewal
- **3 high-priority tasks** like the Q3 budget proposal
- And a healthy mix of medium and low priority items

What's powerful here is the AI has already analyzed and prioritized everything based on deadlines, keywords, and business context. No more guessing what to work on first."

**[Action: Hover over the overdue tasks widget]**

"See this red indicator? FizzTask alerts you to overdue items immediately so nothing falls through the cracks."

## üìß SECTION 2: EMAIL INTELLIGENCE (1:00 - 2:00)

**[Scene: Navigate to Emails page]**

**Narration:**
"Now, let's see where the magic really happens - your email inbox.

Traditional email clients just show you messages. FizzTask sees *opportunities* and *obligations*."

**[Action: Show email list with processed indicators]**

"Notice these green checkmarks? They indicate emails that FizzTask has already processed for tasks. Let me show you what our AI discovered..."

**[Action: Navigate to Tasks page filtered by email source]**

"From just this morning's emails, FizzTask automatically extracted and created these tasks:
- Review presentation slides 15-20 - flagged as urgent
- Add Q3 revenue projections to slide 18 - due today at 6 PM
- Prepare talking points for technical architecture
- Complete API authentication module by Thursday
- Review partnership agreement sections by Wednesday

Each task maintains a direct link to its source email for full context."

**[Alternative Approach - Show the extraction review screen if available]**

"When an email arrives, FizzTask's AI analyzes it instantly. Here's an example of what it found in this client presentation email - 4 specific action items, each with intelligent priority and deadline assignment."

## ‚úÖ SECTION 3: SMART TASK MANAGEMENT (2:00 - 2:45)

**[Scene: Stay on Tasks page]**

**Narration:**
"Your Tasks page becomes your command center. Look how FizzTask has automatically organized everything:

- **Urgent tasks** like the software license renewal are at the top
- Each task shows its AI-detected priority level
- Smart categorization into work, legal, finance, and other relevant categories

The AI doesn't just extract tasks - it understands context. Notice how it identified that 'EOD today' means 6 PM and 'next Thursday' converted to June 15th."

**[Action: Click on a task to show details]**

"Every task maintains a link back to its source email or document, so you always have full context. You can see this task came from Michael Chen's email about the client presentation.

And when you complete a task..."

**[Action: Mark a task as complete]**

"...FizzTask updates your progress metrics in real-time. You can actually see your productivity improving!"

---

## üîî SECTION 4: INTELLIGENT FOLLOW-UPS (2:45 - 3:30)

**[Scene: Navigate to Follow-ups page]**

**Narration:**
"Here's where FizzTask really shines - automated follow-up management.

Look at these two critical follow-ups the AI identified:
1. Following up on the Q3 budget approval with Jennifer
2. Checking on the software license renewal with IT

These were automatically created based on email patterns and keywords like 'please confirm' and 'waiting for your response'."

**[Action: Click on a follow-up item to show details]**

"FizzTask tracks the original email context and suggests optimal follow-up timing based on the urgency and business importance. You'll never forget to circle back on important conversations."

---

## üìÑ SECTION 5: DOCUMENT INTELLIGENCE (3:30 - 4:15)

**[Scene: Navigate to Documents page - Analytics tab]**

**Narration:**
"The Documents hub shows the true power of FizzTask's AI engine.

In our analytics, you can see we've successfully processed:
- Excel spreadsheets containing budget tasks and deadlines
- PDF contracts with embedded review requirements
- PowerPoint presentations with action items in the slides

FizzTask supports PDF, Word, Excel, CSV, and text files - covering virtually all business documents."

**[Action: Show document history with task counts]**

"Look at these results:
- This partnership agreement PDF? 17 tasks extracted including review deadlines
- The Q3 budget spreadsheet? 8 financial tasks with specific due dates
- Even the presentation file revealed 4 hidden action items

With an average confidence score of 92%, you can trust that FizzTask catches what matters."

## üéØ CLOSING: THE FIZZTASK ADVANTAGE (4:15 - 4:45)

## üé¨ REVISED PRODUCTION NOTES:

### What NOT to Click (Avoid Live Processing):
‚ùå "Extract Tasks" button on emails
‚ùå "Process" button on attachments
‚ùå "Scan Document" on new uploads
‚ùå Any action that triggers AI processing

### What TO Show Instead:
‚úÖ Already processed results
‚úÖ Task list filtered by source
‚úÖ Document history with extraction counts
‚úÖ Analytics and statistics
‚úÖ Completed examples

### Alternative Approaches:

1. **Pre-process Everything:**
   - Run all extractions before recording
   - Show the results and history
   - Focus on the outcomes, not the process

2. **Use Screenshots/Mockups:**
   - For extraction screens, use static images
   - Show "before and after" states
   - Add motion graphics in post-production

3. **Narrative Approach:**
   - "FizzTask has already processed these emails..."
   - "Let me show you what our AI discovered..."
   - "Here are the tasks that were automatically created..."

### If You Want to Show Live Processing:

Create "real" content for one demo:
1. Send yourself an actual business email with real tasks
2. Attach a real document with actual action items
3. Process it live to show authentic extraction
4. Have a backup plan if it doesn't work perfectly

This revised approach focuses on showing the RESULTS of FizzTask's intelligence rather than the live processing, making your demo more reliable and professional!
