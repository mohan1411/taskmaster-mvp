# Git Operations Guide for TaskMaster MVP

## Current Git Structure

### Branches
- **main**: Primary development branch (default)
- **develop**: Feature development branch (exists but not actively used)
- **bugfix/critical-security-fixes**: Security fixes branch
- **bugfix/input-validation**: Input validation fixes
- **improvement/database-indexes**: Database optimization branch

### Tags (Releases)
- **v1.1.4**: Latest release (2025-06-26) - Includes task extraction fix for multiple tasks

## Git Workflow

### 1. Regular Development
```bash
# Always work on main branch for now
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Make changes
git add -A
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Creating a New Release

**Important**: We use TAGS for releases, NOT branches!

```bash
# Ensure you're on main with latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v1.1.5 -m "Release v1.1.5 - Description of changes"

# Push tag to remote
git push origin v1.1.5
```

### 3. Production Deployment Strategy

When deploying to production (Railway), we need to exclude test-only changes:

1. **Database Schema Changes to Exclude**:
   - Email model's `body` field (test-only)
   - Any test data generation code

2. **Safe Production Files**:
   - All bug fixes
   - All feature implementations
   - All performance improvements
   - Email attachment functionality (restored)

### 4. Common Git Operations

#### Check Current Status
```bash
git status
git branch -a  # List all branches
git tag -l     # List all tags
```

#### View Recent Commits
```bash
git log --oneline -10
```

#### Cherry-pick Specific Commits (if needed)
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

#### Delete Branches
```bash
# Delete local branch
git branch -D branch-name

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

#### Delete Tags
```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d tag-name

# Delete remote tag
git push origin --delete tag-name
```

### Production Deployment Notes
- Railway deployment uses tags, not branches
- Always create tags from main branch
- Tag format: v[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]
- Current version: v1.1.4
- Next version should be: v1.1.5

### Environment Variables
- DOCUMENT_PARSER_MODE: Not set (defaults to 'simple-only')
- Parser modes available: 'simple-only', 'openai-first', 'openai-only'

## Commit Message Format
```
Short description of change

## Quick Reference Commands

### For Production Release
```bash
# 1. Ensure on main with latest
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create and push tag
git tag -a v1.1.5 -m "Release v1.1.5 - Your description"
git push origin v1.1.5

# 3. Deploy on Railway using tag v1.1.5
```

### For Committing Changes
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```

## Notes for Future Sessions
- We use tags (not branches) for releases
- Current production version is v1.1.4
- Main branch is the primary development branch
- All recent fixes are included in v1.1.4 tag
- Task extraction now properly finds multiple tasks in documents
