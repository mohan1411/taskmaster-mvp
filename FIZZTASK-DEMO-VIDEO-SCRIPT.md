## üé¨ OPENING (0:00 - 0:20)

**[Scene: FizzTask Logo Animation]**

**Narration:**
"Are you drowning in emails, losing track of important tasks, and missing critical deadlines? 

What if AI could automatically turn your chaotic inbox into an organized, prioritized task list?

Welcome to FizzTask - where artificial intelligence meets productivity. Let me show you how FizzTask transforms the way you work."

## üìä SECTION 1: DASHBOARD (0:20 - 1:00)

**[Scene: Login and Dashboard Overview]**

**Narration:**
"As soon as you log into FizzTask, you're greeted with a powerful dashboard that gives you complete visibility of your workday.

Notice how we have:
- **8 active tasks** that need attention
- **2 tasks already in progress** 
- **10 unread emails** waiting to be processed
- And **2 pending follow-ups** to keep relationships moving

The dashboard intelligently categorizes your tasks:
- **2 urgent items** that need immediate attention - including that overdue software license renewal
- **3 high-priority tasks** like the Q3 budget proposal
- And a healthy mix of medium and low priority items

What's powerful here is the AI has already analyzed and prioritized everything based on deadlines, keywords, and business context. No more guessing what to work on first."

**[Action: Hover over the overdue tasks widget]**

"See this red indicator? FizzTask alerts you to overdue items immediately so nothing falls through the cracks."

## üìß SECTION 2: EMAIL INTELLIGENCE (1:00 - 2:00)

**[Scene: Navigate to Emails page]**

**Narration:**
"Now, let's see where the magic really happens - your email inbox.

Traditional email clients just show you messages. FizzTask sees *opportunities* and *obligations*."

**[Action: Click on the urgent client presentation email]**

"Look at this email from Michael Chen about tomorrow's client presentation. In seconds, FizzTask identifies:
- 4 specific action items
- The urgent deadline
- Even the priority level

Watch what happens when I click 'Extract Tasks'..."

**[Action: Click Extract Tasks button]**

"Boom! FizzTask instantly creates:
1. Review presentation slides 15-20
2. Add Q3 revenue projections to slide 18  
3. Prepare talking points for technical architecture
4. Send feedback by 6 PM today

Each task has the correct due date and priority already set. What used to take 10 minutes of manual entry now happens in one click."

**[Action: Show email with attachment]**

"But it gets better. See this attachment? FizzTask can extract tasks from documents too."

**[Action: Click on attachment processing]**

"From this single PowerPoint attachment, FizzTask found 3 additional tasks hidden in the slides. No more missing important action items buried in attachments!"

## ‚úÖ SECTION 3: SMART TASK MANAGEMENT (2:00 - 2:45)

**[Scene: Navigate to Tasks page]**

**Narration:**
"Your Tasks page becomes your command center. Look how FizzTask has automatically organized everything:

- **Urgent tasks** like the software license renewal are at the top
- The client presentation tasks we just extracted are already here
- Each task shows its source - whether from email, documents, or manually created

The AI doesn't just extract tasks - it understands context. Notice how it identified that 'EOD today' means 6 PM and set the deadline accordingly."

**[Action: Click on a task to show details]**

"Every task maintains a link back to its source email or document, so you always have full context. 

And when you complete a task..."

**[Action: Mark a task as complete]**

"Here's where FizzTask really shines - automated follow-up management.

Look at these two critical follow-ups the AI identified:
1. Following up on the Q3 budget approval with Jennifer
2. Checking on the software license renewal with IT

FizzTask doesn't just remind you to follow up - it drafts intelligent messages based on the original context."

**[Action: Click on a follow-up item]**

"See this? FizzTask has already drafted a professional follow-up email that references the original conversation and includes relevant details. Just review and send - saving you 5-10 minutes per follow-up."
