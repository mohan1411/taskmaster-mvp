# TaskMaster Dashboard - Container-Based Layout Fix

## Issue
Despite multiple attempts to fix layout issues, some dashboard content remained not fully visible.

## Solution
We've completely restructured the dashboard layout using a Container-based approach that:

1. **Uses Material UI Container Component** 
   - Enforces maximum width constraints
   - Centers content within the viewport
   - Properly handles spacing and padding

2. **Simplified Grid Structure**
   - Avoids nested grids where possible
   - Uses consistent spacing (spacing={2})
   - Adds proper margin-bottom (mb={3}) between sections

3. **Proper Card Handling**
   - Uses height: '100%' for cards in side-by-side layouts
   - Simplified card content positioning
   - Added noWrap to text that might overflow

## Key Changes

### 1. Container Structure
```jsx
<Container maxWidth="lg" sx={{ py: 4 }}>
  {/* Content goes here */}
</Container>
```

The Container component:
- Sets a maximum width (lg = 1200px)
- Centers content horizontally
- Adds consistent vertical padding

### 2. Sequential Section Layout

Rather than using nested grids, we've structured the dashboard as a sequence of sections:

```jsx
<Container>
  {/* Welcome section */}
  <Paper sx={{ mb: 3 }}>...</Paper>
  
  {/* Stats section */}
  <Typography>Stats Overview</Typography>
  <Grid container spacing={2} sx={{ mb: 3 }}>...</Grid>
  
  {/* Two column layout */}
  <Grid container spacing={2} sx={{ mb: 3 }}>...</Grid>
  
  {/* Recent tasks section */}
  <Card sx={{ mb: 3 }}>...</Card>
</Container>
```

This approach:
- Ensures each section is properly spaced
- Avoids complex nesting that can cause overflow
- Makes the layout more predictable

### 3. Consistent Spacing

Added consistent margins between sections:
```jsx
sx={{ mb: 3 }}
```

And consistent spacing within grids:
```jsx
<Grid container spacing={2}>
```

## Result

The dashboard now:
1. Is properly contained within the viewport width
2. Displays all content without horizontal scrolling
3. Maintains consistent spacing and alignment
4. Works properly on all screen sizes
