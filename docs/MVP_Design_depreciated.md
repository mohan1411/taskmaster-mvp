# TaskMaster AI - MVP Design Document

## Executive Summary
TaskMaster AI is an intelligent assistant designed specifically for small business owners and solopreneurs to automate administrative tasks, saving them 10+ hours per week. This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) design to be implemented within a 2-month timeframe.

## Core Problem Statement
Small business owners and solopreneurs spend excessive time on routine administrative tasks that could be automated, taking away from higher-value activities that grow their business.

## Solution Overview
TaskMaster AI extracts actionable tasks from various communication channels, organizes them intelligently, follows up on pending items, and provides a unified dashboard for business owners to maintain control while delegating routine work.

## Target Users
- Solopreneurs
- Small business owners with 1-5 employees
- Freelancers with multiple clients
- Service-based businesses with high client communication volume

## Key MVP Features

### 1. Email Task Extraction
- Parse incoming emails to identify action items and commitments
- Extract deadlines and priority levels where explicitly stated
- Create structured task entries from unstructured email content

### 2. Smart Task Organization
- Automatically categorize tasks by project, client, or type
- Assign default priority levels based on sender, keywords, and context
- Create logical groupings to minimize context switching

### 3. Follow-up Management
- Track outgoing communications that require responses
- Generate automatic follow-up reminders after configurable periods
- Provide templates for common follow-up scenarios

### 4. Basic Scheduling
- Identify scheduling-related communications
- Suggest available time slots based on calendar integration
- Send calendar invites upon confirmation

### 5. Dashboard & Reporting
- Daily task overview with priorities and deadlines
- Weekly summary of completed tasks and pending items
- Simple metrics on response times and task completion rates
