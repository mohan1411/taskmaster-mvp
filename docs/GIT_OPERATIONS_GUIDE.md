## Git Workflow

### 1. Development Workflow (Day-to-Day Development)

**Important**: All development work should be done on the `develop` branch!

```bash
# Switch to develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Make changes
git add -A
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin develop
```

### 2. Releasing to Production

When ready to release develop changes to production:

```bash
# Step 1: Ensure develop is up to date
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Step 2: Merge develop into main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge develop
git push origin main

# Step 3: Create release tag
git tag -a v1.1.5 -m "Release v1.1.5 - Description of changes"
git push origin v1.1.5

# Step 4: Railway automatically deploys from main branch
# Monitor deployment at Railway dashboard
```

### 3. Hotfix Workflow (Emergency Production Fixes)

For urgent production fixes:

```bash
# Create hotfix from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue

# Make fixes
git add -A
git commit -m "Hotfix: Description"

# Merge to main
git checkout main
git merge hotfix/critical-issue
git push origin main

# Create hotfix tag
git tag -a v1.1.5-hotfix1 -m "Hotfix: Description"
git push origin v1.1.5-hotfix1

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge main
git push origin develop

# Delete hotfix branch
git branch -D hotfix/critical-issue
```

### 4. Production Deployment Strategy

When deploying to production (Railway), we need to exclude test-only changes:

1. **Database Schema Changes to Exclude**:
   - Email model's `body` field (test-only)
   - Any test data generation code

2. **Safe Production Files**:
   - All bug fixes
   - All feature implementations
   - All performance improvements
   - Email attachment functionality (restored)

### 5. Common Git Operations

#### Check Current Status
```bash
git status
git branch -a  # List all branches
git tag -l     # List all tags
```

#### View Recent Commits
```bash
git log --oneline -10
```

#### Cherry-pick Specific Commits (if needed)
```bash
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

#### Delete Branches
```bash
# Delete local branch
git branch -D branch-name

# Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

#### Delete Tags
```bash
# Delete local tag
git tag -d tag-name

# Delete remote tag
git push origin --delete tag-name
```

### Production Deployment Notes
- **Railway deploys from `main` branch automatically**
- Push to main = Automatic deployment to production
- Tags are for version tracking and rollback reference
- Tag format: v[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]
- Current version: v1.1.4
- Next version should be: v1.1.5

### Environment Variables

**Production (Railway)**:
- `NODE_ENV`: production
- `MONGODB_URI`: Production MongoDB connection string
- `JWT_SECRET`: Production secret (different from dev)
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: OAuth client ID
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`: OAuth client secret
- `FRONTEND_URL`: https://taskmaster-mvp.up.railway.app
- `DOCUMENT_PARSER_MODE`: Not set (defaults to 'simple-only')
- Parser modes available: 'simple-only', 'openai-first', 'openai-only'

**Development (Local)**:
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
- Use local MongoDB or MongoDB Atlas dev cluster
- Different JWT_SECRET for security

## Quick Reference Commands

### For Development Work
```bash
# Always start by updating develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Make changes and commit
git add -A
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin develop
```

### For Production Release
```bash
# 1. Update both branches
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Merge develop to main
git merge develop
git push origin main

# 3. Create and push tag
git tag -a v1.1.5 -m "Release v1.1.5 - Your description"
git push origin v1.1.5

# 4. Railway automatically deploys from main branch
# Monitor deployment at Railway dashboard
```

### Syncing Develop with Latest Production
```bash
# After a hotfix or direct main branch update
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge main
git push origin develop
```

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before merging to main (production):

1. **Check for Test-Only Code**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run check:test-code
   ```
   See `TEST_CODE_PATTERNS.md` for details

2. **Test Locally**
   ```bash
   # Backend tests
   cd backend
   npm test
   
   # Frontend build
   cd ../frontend
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Check for Package Updates**
   ```bash
   # If package.json was modified
   cd backend && npm install
   cd ../frontend && npm install
   ```

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Ensure all new env variables are added to Railway
   - Check `.env.example` is updated

5. **Database Changes**
   - Document any schema changes
   - Prepare migration scripts if needed
   - Backup production database before deployment

## Rollback Procedures

If production has issues after deployment:

```bash
# Quick rollback to previous version
git checkout main
git reset --hard v1.1.4  # Previous stable tag
git push --force origin main

# Railway will automatically redeploy

# After fixing the issue
git checkout develop
git pull origin main  # Get the rollback state
# Fix the issue...
```

## Feature Branch Workflow

For new features:

```bash
# Create feature branch from develop
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/new-feature-name

# Work on feature
git add -A
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Merge back to develop
git checkout develop
git merge feature/new-feature-name
git push origin develop

# Delete feature branch
git branch -D feature/new-feature-name
```

## Railway-Specific Information

- **Deployment**: Automatic from `main` branch
- **Build Command**: Automatically detected
- **Environment Variables**: Set in Railway dashboard
- **Logs**: Check Railway dashboard for deployment and runtime logs
- **Rollback**: Use git reset and force push to main

## Important Commands Reference

### Before Deployment
```bash
# Check what will be deployed
git diff develop..main

# See commit differences
git log develop..main --oneline
```

### After Package.json Changes
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm audit fix  # Fix vulnerabilities

# Frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm audit fix
```

### Database Backup (MongoDB)
```bash
# Before major releases
mongodump --uri="mongodb://..." --out=backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

## Notes for Future Sessions
- Development happens on `develop` branch
- Production releases go to `main` branch
- We use tags (not branches) for releases
- Current production version is v1.1.4
- All recent fixes are included in v1.1.4 tag
- Task extraction now properly finds multiple tasks in documents

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Railway Deployment Failed
1. Check Railway logs for error messages
2. Common issues:
   - Missing environment variables
   - Package not found (run npm install locally first)
   - Build errors (test with `npm run build` locally)

### Merge Conflicts
```bash
# If develop has conflicts with main
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git merge main
# Resolve conflicts manually
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin develop
```

### Package Version Conflicts
```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Database Connection Issues
- Check MONGODB_URI in Railway env vars
- Ensure IP whitelist includes Railway IPs
- Check connection string format

## Current State (as of 2025-06-26)
