# TaskMaster: Follow-up System Enhancement Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the planned enhancements to the Follow-up System in TaskMaster, scheduled for implementation during our next deep work session. The follow-up system is a core component of TaskMaster that helps users track and manage communications that require attention or responses, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.

## Background
We recently completed significant improvements to the email integration and follow-up labeling system. Building on this foundation, we'll now enhance the follow-up management capabilities to provide more value to users and differentiate TaskMaster in the productivity tools market.

## Objectives
- Create a more intelligent and proactive follow-up system
- Provide deeper insights into follow-up patterns and effectiveness
- Reduce user cognitive load in managing follow-ups
- Implement features that leverage AI for smarter follow-up handling

## Feature Implementation Plan

### 1. Smart Follow-up Reminders
**Purpose:** Proactively notify users about pending follow-ups before they become overdue.

**Components:**
- **Notification Engine**: Create a system to generate timely alerts based on follow-up due dates
- **Priority-Based Timing**: Configure reminder timing based on follow-up priority (high priority = earlier reminders)
- **Multi-Channel Notifications**: Implement in-app, email, and browser notifications
- **Snooze Function**: Allow users to temporarily dismiss reminders and reschedule them

**Technical Approach:**
- Build a background job that periodically checks for upcoming follow-ups
- Integrate with browser notification API for desktop alerts
- Create a notification preferences system in user settings

### 2. Follow-up Analytics
**Purpose:** Provide insights into follow-up patterns and help users improve their communication effectiveness.

**Components:**
- **Response Rate Tracking**: Monitor which follow-ups receive responses
- **Time-to-Resolution Metrics**: Track how quickly follow-ups get resolved
- **User Dashboard**: Visual representation of follow-up statistics
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify patterns in which types of communications tend to need follow-ups

**Technical Approach:**
- Extend the follow-up data model to track status changes and response detection
- Implement data aggregation queries for analytics generation
- Create visualization components using chart libraries

### 3. AI-Powered Follow-up Suggestions
**Purpose:** Leverage AI to make follow-ups more effective and easier to manage.

**Components:**
- **Response Drafts**: Generate suggested content for follow-up messages
- **Optimal Timing Suggestions**: Recommend the best time to send follow-ups based on historical data
- **Context Retrieval**: Automatically pull relevant information from previous communications
- **Smart Categorization**: Automatically categorize follow-ups by urgency and type

**Technical Approach:**
- Integrate with OpenAI API for content generation
- Implement pattern recognition for timing optimization
- Create a context aggregation system that retrieves relevant historical data

### 4. Follow-up Workflows
**Purpose:** Support more complex follow-up scenarios with structured processes.

**Components:**
- **Multi-Stage Sequences**: Define follow-up steps that progress through different stages
- **Escalation Paths**: Configure automatic escalation for critical follow-ups
- **Team Collaboration**: Enable multiple team members to collaborate on follow-ups
- **Templates**: Create reusable follow-up workflows for common scenarios

**Technical Approach:**
- Design a workflow engine to manage follow-up states and transitions
- Extend the data model to support team member assignments
- Implement a template system for follow-up workflows

## Implementation Priorities
For our deep work session, we'll focus on implementing these features in the following order:

1. Smart Follow-up Reminders - This provides immediate value with moderate complexity
2. Basic Follow-up Analytics - Adds insight capabilities but depends on existing data
3. Initial AI Suggestion Features - Introduces more advanced capabilities
4. Core Workflow Functionality - Builds foundations for more complex follow-up handling

## Technical Considerations
- Ensure all new features maintain backward compatibility with existing follow-up data
- Design for scalability as the number of follow-ups increases
- Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Consider performance implications, especially for analytics calculations

## Success Metrics
- Reduction in overdue follow-ups
- Increased follow-up completion rate
- User engagement with new follow-up features
- Time saved in managing communication follow-ups

## Next Steps
During our deep work session, we'll begin implementation with the Smart Follow-up Reminders system, focusing on the notification engine and priority-based timing components.

## Database Schema Extensions

### Follow-up Model Additions
```javascript
// New fields to add to the followupSchema
reminderSettings: {
  enabled: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: true
  },
  schedule: [{
    type: String,  // Relative time like '1d', '2h', etc.
    notificationType: {
      type: String,
      enum: ['in-app', 'email', 'browser'],
      default: 'in-app'
    }
  }],
  lastReminderSent: Date
},
responseTracking: {
  responded: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false
  },
  responseDetectedAt: Date,
  responseMessageId: String,
  responseMethod: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['email', 'manual', 'other'],
    default: 'email'
  }
},
escalation: {
  isEscalated: {
    type: Boolean,
    default: false
  },
  escalatedTo: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User'
  },
  escalatedAt: Date,
  escalationReason: String
},
workflow: {
  template: {
    type: String,
    default: 'standard'
  },
  currentStage: {
    type: String,
    default: 'initial'
  },
  stages: [{
    name: String,
    completedAt: Date,
    notes: String
  }]
}
```
