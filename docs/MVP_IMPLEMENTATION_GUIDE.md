# TaskMaster MVP Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document outlines the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) implementation of TaskMaster. The MVP focuses on providing core functionality with manual task and follow-up extraction while keeping the groundwork for future smart features.

## MVP Approach

For the MVP version, we've decided to:

1. **Focus on manual extraction:** Users will manually extract tasks and follow-ups from emails using the UI.
2. **Disable automatic processing:** Automatic task/follow-up detection during email sync is disabled.
3. **Keep smart code in codebase:** All smart extraction code is kept but disabled for future implementation.

## Features Included in MVP

### Email Management
- Gmail integration for syncing emails
- Email listing, filtering, and searching
- Email detail view

### Task Management
- Manual extraction of tasks from emails
- Task creation, editing, and deletion
- Task prioritization and due dates
- Task status tracking

### Follow-Up Management
- Manual creation of follow-ups from emails
- Follow-up tracking and reminders
- Follow-up completion tracking

## Features Excluded from MVP (Coming Soon)

### Smart Processing
- Automatic task extraction during email sync
- Automatic follow-up detection during email sync
- Batch processing of emails
- Smart filtering and selective processing

### Advanced Features
- Email analytics and insights
- Integration with calendar for scheduling
- Task templates and automation

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes
1. Disabled automatic processing in `emailController.js` while keeping the code.
2. Disabled smart processing routes in `unifiedEmailRoutes.js` but kept them in code.
3. Updated unified email processor to work in manual mode only.
4. Added clear MVP notices to smart processing controllers.

### Frontend Changes
1. Updated Settings page to indicate manual-only functionality in MVP.
2. Kept the UI for manual extraction intact.

## Future Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Re-enable automatic processing**
   - Enable automatic task/follow-up detection during email sync
   - Add settings to control automatic processing

2. **Phase 2: Add smart processing**
   - Enable batch processing features
   - Implement smart filtering
   - Add processing recommendations

3. **Phase 3: Advanced features**
   - Add analytics and insights
   - Implement calendar integration
   - Add task templates and automation

## Testing the MVP

To test the MVP functionality:

1. Connect your Gmail account through the settings
2. Sync emails using the sync button
3. Click on an email to open the detail view
4. Use the "Extract Tasks" or "Create Follow-up" buttons to manually extract items

## Feedback and Iteration

Please provide feedback on the MVP implementation to help prioritize features for the next iteration.
