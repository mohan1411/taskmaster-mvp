# Smart Follow-up Reminders User Guide

## Overview

The Smart Follow-up Reminders feature helps you stay on top of your communications by sending proactive reminders about pending follow-ups. Never miss an important follow-up again with multi-channel notifications, intelligent timing, and easy management.

## Key Features

### 1. Smart Reminder Timing

Reminders are sent at strategic times before your follow-up is due, ensuring you have enough time to prepare. The system intelligently adjusts reminder timing based on priority:

- **Standard Timing**: Reminders sent according to your configured schedule (e.g., 1 day before due date)
- **High Priority**: Reminders sent 50% earlier (e.g., 1.5 days before due date)
- **Urgent Priority**: Reminders sent twice as early (e.g., 2 days before due date)

### 2. Multi-Channel Notifications

Receive reminders through multiple channels to ensure you never miss an important follow-up:

- **In-App Notifications**: See reminders directly in the TaskMaster interface
- **Email Notifications**: Get detailed follow-up reminders in your inbox
- **Browser Notifications**: Receive desktop notifications even when TaskMaster isn't your active tab

### 3. Reminder Management

Easily manage your reminder preferences:

- **Configure Schedule**: Set when you want to receive reminders (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day, or 1 week before due date)
- **Choose Channels**: Select which notification channels you prefer for each reminder
- **Enable/Disable**: Turn reminders on or off for specific follow-ups
- **Snooze Function**: Temporarily postpone reminders when you need more time
