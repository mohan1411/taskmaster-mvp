# TaskMaster Follow-up Detection and Management

## Overview

The follow-up detection and management feature enhances TaskMaster's email productivity capabilities by automatically identifying emails that require follow-up and managing these follow-up tasks. This document outlines the implementation of this feature.

## Core Components

### 1. Follow-up Detection

The system uses OpenAI's API to analyze email content and determine if follow-up action is needed by examining:

- Explicit questions that need answers
- Requests for actions, information, or feedback
- Deadlines or timeframes mentioned for a response
- Implied expectations of a reply

For each detected follow-up, the system identifies:
- The reason follow-up is needed
- Suggested follow-up date
- Key points to address in the follow-up

### 2. Follow-up Management

The system provides a complete workflow for managing follow-ups:

- Follow-up list view with filtering and sorting
- Detailed follow-up information display
- Status tracking (pending, in-progress, completed, ignored)
- Priority management (low, medium, high, urgent)
- Due date tracking and reminders
- Notes and key points management

### 3. Analytics and Insights

The system offers analytics about follow-ups:

- Status distribution
- Due follow-ups (today, this week)
- Overdue follow-ups
- Completion rate
- Average completion time

## Implementation Details

### Backend Components

1. **MongoDB Schema**: A comprehensive data model for follow-ups including status, priority, due date, contact information, and related data.

2. **Follow-up Controller**: API endpoints for CRUD operations on follow-ups and follow-up detection.

3. **AI Integration**: OpenAI API integration with prompt engineering for effective follow-up detection.

### Frontend Components

1. **Follow-ups Page**: Main interface for viewing and managing follow-ups.

2. **Follow-up Modal**: Component for creating, viewing, and editing follow-ups.

3. **Detection Button**: Interface for triggering follow-up detection on emails.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/followups` - Get all follow-ups with filtering
- `GET /api/followups/:id` - Get a specific follow-up
- `POST /api/followups` - Create a new follow-up manually
- `PUT /api/followups/:id` - Update a follow-up
- `DELETE /api/followups/:id` - Delete a follow-up
- `GET /api/followups/check-due` - Check for due follow-ups
- `GET /api/followups/analytics` - Get follow-up analytics
- `POST /api/emails/:id/detect-followup` - Detect follow-up needs in an email

## AI Implementation

The follow-up detection uses the following prompt pattern:

```
Analyze this email to determine if it requires a follow-up response. Check for:
1. Explicit questions that need answers
2. Requests for actions, information, or feedback
3. Deadlines or timeframes mentioned for a response
4. Implied expectations of a reply

If a follow-up is needed, provide:
1. A brief reason why follow-up is needed
2. Suggested follow-up date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
3. Key points to address in the follow-up

Format the response as a valid JSON object:
{
  "needsFollowUp": true/false,
  "reason": "Brief explanation of why follow-up is needed",
  "suggestedDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "keyPoints": ["Point 1", "Point 2", ...]
}
```

## Integration with Task Management

Follow-ups and tasks are related but distinct entities in TaskMaster:

- Follow-ups focus on response management and communication tracking
- Tasks focus on action items and deliverables

The system allows:
- Converting follow-ups to tasks when appropriate
- Linking related tasks to follow-ups
- Providing a comprehensive view of both communication follow-ups and actionable tasks

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements to the follow-up functionality:

1. **Smart Scheduling**: AI-powered suggestions for optimal follow-up timing
2. **Email Templates**: Pre-written follow-up email templates
3. **Automated Follow-ups**: Scheduled reminders and notifications
4. **Follow-up Chains**: Tracking of follow-up threads and conversations
5. **Integration with Calendar**: Scheduling follow-up meetings and calls

## Usage Guide

### Detecting Follow-up Needs

1. Open an email in the TaskMaster application
2. Click the "Detect Follow-up" button (schedule icon)
3. Review the AI analysis of follow-up needs
4. If follow-up is needed, a follow-up record will be automatically created

### Managing Follow-ups

1. Navigate to the Follow-ups page
2. View all follow-ups sorted by due date
3. Filter by status, priority, or search terms
4. Click on a follow-up to view details
5. Update follow-up status as you process it
6. Mark as completed when the follow-up is done
