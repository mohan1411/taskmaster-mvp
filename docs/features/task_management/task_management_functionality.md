## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components

1. **TaskForm** (`components/tasks/TaskForm.js`)
   - Handles task creation and editing
   - Form validation with Formik
   - Support for all task properties and labels

2. **TaskList** (`components/tasks/TaskList.js`)
   - Displays tasks with filtering and sorting
   - Handles task actions (status changes, edit, delete)
   - Search and filter interface
   - Responsive layout for all screen sizes

3. **TaskModal** (`components/tasks/TaskModal.js`)
   - Modal dialog for task creation/editing
   - Integration with TaskForm component

4. **DeleteConfirmationDialog** (`components/common/DeleteConfirmationDialog.js`)
   - Reusable confirmation dialog for task deletion

5. **TasksPage** (`pages/TasksPage.js`)
   - Main page for task management
   - Integrates all task components
   - Handles loading states and error handling

### Backend Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| GET | /api/tasks | Get all tasks with filtering options |
| POST | /api/tasks | Create a new task |
| GET | /api/tasks/:id | Get a specific task by ID |
| PUT | /api/tasks/:id | Update a task |
| DELETE | /api/tasks/:id | Delete a task |
| GET | /api/tasks/analytics | Get task statistics and analytics |

### API Services

The `taskService.js` provides the following API functions:

- `getTasks(filters)`: Fetch tasks with filtering options
- `getTaskById(taskId)`: Get a single task by ID
- `createTask(taskData)`: Create a new task
- `updateTask(taskId, taskData)`: Update an existing task
- `deleteTask(taskId)`: Delete a task
- `updateTaskStatus(taskId, status)`: Update just the status of a task
- `getTaskAnalytics()`: Get task statistics and analytics
- `extractTasksFromText(text)`: Extract tasks from text (for AI integration)
- `saveExtractedTasks(tasks)`: Save extracted tasks

### Data Models

The core task model includes:

```javascript
{
  user: ObjectId,           // Reference to the user who owns the task
  title: String,            // Task title
  description: String,      // Detailed task description
  status: String,           // 'pending', 'in-progress', 'completed', 'archived'
  priority: String,         // 'low', 'medium', 'high', 'urgent'
  dueDate: Date,            // Task deadline
  emailSource: String,      // Email ID if task was extracted from email
  category: String,         // Task category ('work', 'personal', etc.)
  aiGenerated: Boolean,     // Whether the task was generated by AI
  labels: [String],         // Custom labels/tags
  completedAt: Date         // When the task was completed
}
```

## User Interface Design

### Task Creation/Editing

The task form provides a clean, intuitive interface for task creation and editing:

- Title and description fields
- Priority selection with visual indicators
- Status selection with logical options
- Category assignment from predefined list
- Due date selection with date/time picker
- Label management with add/remove capability

### Task List View

The task list provides an organized view of tasks with:

- Visual priority indicators (color-coded)
- Status badges
- Due date information with overdue warnings
- Quick actions for status changes
- Access to edit and delete operations
- Filter and search capabilities

### Task Actions

Users can perform the following actions on tasks:

- Create new tasks via button or FAB (on mobile)
- Edit tasks via menu or double-click
- Delete tasks with confirmation
- Change status directly from task card
- Mark as complete with quick action button
- Filter and search with intuitive controls

## Design Decisions

### Task Prioritization System

- Four-level priority system (low, medium, high, urgent)
- Color-coded for visual distinction:
  - Low: Green
  - Medium: Blue
  - High: Orange/Yellow
  - Urgent: Red

### Task Status Flow

- Logical progression through task lifecycle:
  - Pending → In Progress → Completed
- Option to archive tasks without deletion
- Quick actions for common status transitions

### Task Organization

- Combination of categories and labels for flexible organization
- Categories provide structured organization (work, personal, finance, etc.)
- Labels allow for custom, ad-hoc organization

### Filtering and Sorting

- Comprehensive filtering by all major attributes
- Multiple sort options to support different workflows
- Search functionality for quick task location
- Filter persistence within the session

## Future Enhancements

### Planned for MVP+

| Feature | Priority | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Batch Operations | Medium | Edit or delete multiple tasks at once |
| Task Templates | Medium | Create templates for recurring tasks |
| Drag-and-Drop | Low | Reorder tasks and change status via drag-and-drop |
| Expanded Analytics | Medium | More detailed task analytics and reporting |

### Post-MVP Considerations

| Feature | Priority | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Recurring Tasks | High | Set up tasks that repeat on schedule |
| Subtasks | Medium | Break down tasks into smaller components |
| Task Dependencies | Low | Create relationships between dependent tasks |
| Task Sharing | Low | Share tasks with other users |
| Calendar View | Medium | View tasks in calendar format |

## Testing Scenarios

### Task Creation Testing

1. Create task with all fields populated → Task created successfully
2. Create task with only required fields → Task created successfully
3. Create task with invalid data → Form validation errors shown

### Task Editing Testing

1. Edit task with valid changes → Task updated successfully
2. Edit task status → Task status updated correctly
3. Edit task priority → Task priority updated correctly

### Task Filtering Testing

1. Filter tasks by status → Only matching tasks displayed
2. Filter tasks by priority → Only matching tasks displayed
3. Filter tasks by category → Only matching tasks displayed
4. Search tasks → Only matching tasks displayed
5. Sort tasks → Tasks displayed in correct order

### Task Actions Testing

1. Mark task as completed → Task status updated to completed
2. Delete task → Task removed from list
3. Start task → Task status updated to in-progress

## Known Issues and Limitations

1. **No Subtask Support**: The current implementation does not support hierarchy of tasks or subtasks
2. **Limited Recurring Support**: No built-in support for recurring tasks
3. **Fixed Categories**: Categories are currently hardcoded rather than user-defined
4. **No Batch Operations**: Tasks must be edited or deleted individually

## Conclusion

The task management functionality provides a robust foundation for the TaskMaster application. It includes all essential features required for an MVP, with several areas identified for future enhancement. The current implementation follows best practices for user interface design and task organization, with proper separation of concerns between frontend components and backend API services.
