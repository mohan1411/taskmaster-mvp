/**
 * Gmail OAuth Integration - Fix for Child Dialog Box
 * 
 * This document explains how to fix the issue with the Gmail OAuth flow opening 
 * in a child dialog box instead of redirecting properly.
 */

/**
 * ISSUE SUMMARY:
 * 
 * When clicking the "Connect Gmail" button, the OAuth authorization screen opens in a
 * child dialog box instead of redirecting to the proper page. After authorization, the
 * user stays in the child dialog instead of being redirected back to the main emails page.
 */

/**
 * SOLUTION:
 * 
 * 1. We've modified the GmailConnect.js file to redirect the entire window to the Google OAuth page 
 *    rather than opening a popup.
 * 
 * 2. You'll need to update your Google Cloud Console OAuth configuration to ensure it uses 
 *    the correct redirect URI.
 */

/**
 * ACTION REQUIRED:
 * 
 * 1. Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
 * 
 * 2. Select your project (TaskMaster)
 * 
 * 3. Navigate to: APIs & Services > Credentials
 * 
 * 4. Find and edit your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
 * 
 * 5. Under "Authorized redirect URIs", make sure you have:
 *    http://localhost:3000/auth/gmail/callback
 * 
 * 6. Save the changes
 * 
 * 7. If needed, also update the .env file in your backend directory to match:
 *    GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/gmail/callback
 */

/**
 * TESTING THE FIX:
 * 
 * 1. Restart your frontend application
 * 
 * 2. Navigate to the emails page
 * 
 * 3. Click the "Connect Gmail" button
 * 
 * 4. You should be redirected to the Google authorization screen in the same tab
 *    (not in a popup)
 * 
 * 5. After authorization, you should be redirected back to your emails page and 
 *    emails should automatically sync
