# TaskMaster Dashboard Bug Fixes

## Identified Issues

1. **Data Discrepancy**: The dashboard was showing 0 overdue tasks while the Tasks page showed 5 overdue tasks.
2. **Layout Issues**: Some content was not fully visible due to layout and alignment problems.

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Fixed Overdue Task Count Discrepancy

**Root Cause**: The dashboard was using the analytics endpoint for task counts, which was returning different values than the direct task queries used by the Tasks page.

**Solution**: 
- Changed the data fetching mechanism to directly query all tasks instead of relying on analytics
- Implemented manual calculation of task metrics (total, pending, overdue) using the same logic as the Tasks page
- Added query parameters to the Tasks page navigation to ensure consistent filtering
- Added debugging helpers to identify future discrepancies

### 2. Improved Layout and Styling

**Root Cause**: The layout had improper width constraints and overflow settings.

**Solution**:
- Added proper max-width settings to ensure content stays within the visible area
- Improved StatCard component with responsive styling
- Set proper container alignment to center content
- Added more consistent padding and spacing

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling and Data Display

**Improvements**:
- Added a specific alert for overdue tasks that need attention
- Changed the empty state for "No Tasks Due Today" to suggest checking the task list
- Improved error message styling from warning to info for better user experience

### 4. Added Debugging Capabilities

**Development Features**:
- Added a debug logging function that reports data discrepancies
- Implemented an automatic check that compares API-reported values with locally calculated values
- Added detailed console logs for development troubleshooting

## Technical Implementation

### Updated Data Fetching

The dashboard now uses this approach for getting task data:
1. First attempt: Fetch all tasks and calculate metrics manually
2. Fallback: If that fails, try the analytics endpoint
3. In either case, display whatever data is available

### Debug Mode

When in development mode, the dashboard will:
1. Log all task data to the console
2. Compare locally calculated metrics with API-reported metrics
3. Show warnings for any discrepancies
4. List the actual overdue tasks for verification

## Verification

To verify the fixes:
1. Check that the overdue task count on the dashboard matches the Tasks page
2. Ensure all dashboard content is visible without scrolling horizontally 
3. Confirm the "View All Tasks" link from the overdue card properly filters to show only overdue tasks
4. Check console logs in development mode to ensure no data discrepancies

## Next Steps

For future improvements:
1. Consider adding a server-side endpoint that provides consistent metrics across all pages
2. Implement a shared utility for calculating task metrics to ensure consistency
3. Add automated tests that verify data consistency between different views
