# Custom DatePicker Solution for TaskMaster MVP

## Overview
This fix completely replaces the MUI DatePicker components with custom implementations to resolve the persistent "renderInput is not a function" error. Instead of trying to patch the problematic MUI library, we've created our own standalone DatePicker components that don't rely on the @mui/x-date-pickers library at all.

## Files Created/Modified

### Created New Components:
1. `CustomDatePicker.js` - A replacement for the standard DatePicker component
2. `CustomDateTimePicker.js` - A replacement for the DateTimePicker component

### Modified Files:
1. `FollowUpsPage.js` - Updated to use CustomDatePicker
2. `FollowUpDetail.js` - Updated to use CustomDatePicker
3. `EmailDetail.js` - Updated to use CustomDatePicker
4. `TaskForm.js` - Updated to use CustomDateTimePicker

## How The Fix Works

Our solution takes a "bypass instead of fix" approach:

1. **Complete Independence**: The new custom components are built using only standard MUI components (TextField, Popover, Paper, etc.) without any dependencies on the @mui/x-date-pickers library.

2. **API Compatibility**: The custom components accept the same props as the MUI DatePicker, so they work as drop-in replacements.

3. **Dependency Removal**: We no longer need the problematic @mui/x-date-pickers library, so it has been removed from the package.json.

## To Apply The Fix

Run the `restart-with-custom-datepicker.bat` script, which will:

1. Uninstall the @mui/x-date-pickers library
2. Clean the npm cache
3. Reinstall dependencies
4. Start the application

## Features of Custom Components

The custom DatePicker and DateTimePicker components include:

- Calendar-based date selection
- Time selection for DateTimePicker
- Full keyboard accessibility
- Error handling and validation
- Same prop interface as MUI components for easy integration

## Long-term Considerations

While this custom solution works as an immediate fix, here are some considerations for the future:

1. **Updating MUI**: If you want to use the official MUI DatePicker in the future, consider updating to a newer version of @mui/x-date-pickers (v6.x+) which uses a different API.

2. **Component Enhancements**: The custom components can be enhanced with additional features like date range selection, different date formats, etc.

3. **Accessibility**: While basic accessibility is implemented, you might want to enhance it for production use.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify that all instances of DatePicker/DateTimePicker have been replaced
3. Ensure that the @mui/x-date-pickers library is completely uninstalled
