## ðŸŽ¬ OPENING (0:00 - 0:20)

**[Scene: FizzTask Logo Animation]**

**Narration:**
"Are you drowning in emails, losing track of important tasks, and missing critical deadlines? 

What if AI could automatically extract tasks from your emails AND documents, organizing everything in one intelligent system?

Welcome to FizzTask - your AI-powered productivity assistant. Let me show you how it works."

---

## ðŸ“Š SECTION 1: DASHBOARD OVERVIEW (0:20 - 0:50)

**[Scene: Dashboard showing actual metrics]**

**Narration:**
"The FizzTask dashboard gives you instant visibility into your workday. Right now, we can see:

- **20 active tasks** requiring attention
- **3 overdue tasks** highlighted with a warning - we never let deadlines slip by unnoticed
- **7 unread emails** in your inbox
- **2 follow-ups** to maintain

Notice the 'Due Today' section showing urgent items like 'Review and Sign Partnership Agreement' due at 9:05 PM. 

FizzTask keeps your most pressing tasks front and center, so you always know what needs immediate attention."

**[Action: Point to the overdue alert]**

"This alert ensures overdue tasks get addressed immediately."

## ðŸ“§ SECTION 2: EMAIL INTEGRATION & SECURITY (0:50 - 2:00)

**[Scene: Navigate to Emails page showing Gmail integration]**

**Narration:**
"Let's look at how FizzTask integrates with your email - securely and seamlessly.

FizzTask connects to your Gmail using OAuth 2.0 - the industry standard for secure authentication. This means:
- We NEVER store your Gmail password
- You authenticate directly with Google
- You can revoke access anytime from your Google account
- Your email credentials remain completely secure

Watch how easy it is to sync your emails:"

**[Action: Show/mention the Refresh button]**

"Simply click 'Refresh' to sync your latest emails. FizzTask pulls in your recent messages while respecting your privacy - we only access what's needed for task extraction."

**[Action: Show the email list]**

"Once synced, you'll see your business emails here. Look at this email from Emma Thompson about the Customer Portal Redesign project."

**[Action: Point to the blue buttons and follow-up indicator]**

"Notice three powerful features here:

1. The 'Extract from Email' button - uses AI to find tasks within the email body
2. The 'Follow-up' indicator - FizzTask automatically detects when emails need follow-up responses
3. The 'Extract Tasks from 1 Document' button - analyzes attached files for hidden action items

FizzTask intelligently identifies emails that require follow-up based on keywords like 'please confirm', 'waiting for your response', or questions that need answers."

**[Action: Point to the PDF attachment]**

"This Customer Portal Project Charter PDF contains 662KB of project information. FizzTask can process PDFs, Word documents, Excel files, and more to extract actionable tasks - all without ever leaving your secure environment."

**[Action: Show the urgent email from Customer Success]**

"Here's another critical example - an urgent customer escalation from TechStart Inc. Notice this email has 2 attachments - error logs and requirements documents. FizzTask can process multiple attachments in a single email, extracting action items from each file to ensure nothing is missed during critical customer issues."

---

## âœ… SECTION 3: TASK MANAGEMENT & FILTERING (2:00 - 2:45)

**[Scene: Navigate to Tasks page]**

**Narration:**
"The Tasks page shows everything FizzTask has captured and organized. We currently have:

- **24 total tasks**
- **20 active tasks** 
- **3 overdue** items requiring immediate attention

But FizzTask isn't just about AI extraction - you have full control:"

**[Action: Point to the Filters button]**

"Use the powerful filtering system to view tasks by:
- Priority level (Urgent, High, Medium, Low)
- Status (Pending, Completed, Overdue)
- Category (Work, Personal, Finance)
- Source (Email, Document, Manual)
- Date ranges

This helps you focus on what matters most right now."

**[Action: Point to task creation area]**

"Of course, you can also manually add tasks anytime. While AI extraction saves time, manual task creation ensures nothing falls through the cracks."

**[Action: Point to specific tasks]**

"Notice this task: 'Review all project statuses by Thursday EOD' - marked as urgent. It was extracted from the Weekly Status Report document.

Below that: 'Propose mitigation strategies (Due: Friday 2 PM)' - with medium priority.

What's important here is the source tracking - each task shows it was 'Extracted from: Weekly_Status_Report_Template.docx'. You always have complete context."

**[Action: Highlight the issue with "No due date"]**

"While FizzTask extracts the task content accurately, you can always edit and add specific due dates when the AI cannot determine exact timing from the source text."

---

## ðŸ“„ SECTION 4: DOCUMENT INTELLIGENCE (2:45 - 3:30)

**[Scene: Navigate to Documents page - Document History tab]**

**Narration:**
"The Documents hub is where FizzTask's AI truly shines. We've processed 4 documents with impressive results:

- **21 total tasks extracted**
- **89% average confidence score**
- **100% success rate**

Look at these results:"

**[Action: Point to specific documents]**

"The Weekly Status Report template yielded 18 tasks - that's 18 action items you might have missed by just reading the document!

The Q3 Budget Projections Excel file? 1 task extracted - likely a deadline or approval requirement hidden in the spreadsheet."

**[Action: Switch to Analytics tab]**

"In our analytics, you can see we support multiple file types:
- Excel files for spreadsheets and data
- PDFs for contracts and reports  
- Word documents for templates and memos

Each document type is processed intelligently to find deadlines, action items, and deliverables."

**[Note about PPT]**

"While PowerPoint files appear in our system, they currently need to be converted to PDF for task extraction - a simple extra step for presentation files."

---

## ðŸ”” SECTION 5: FOLLOW-UP MANAGEMENT & FILTERING (3:30 - 4:00)

**[Scene: Navigate to Follow-ups page]**

**Narration:**
"FizzTask's intelligent follow-up system ensures important conversations never fall through the cracks.

We currently have 2 follow-ups:
- One due today 
- Another due in 3 days

These were automatically detected from emails containing phrases like:
- 'Please confirm by...'
- 'Waiting for your response'
- 'Let me know if...'
- Questions requiring answers"

**[Action: Point to filtering options]**

"Just like tasks, you can filter follow-ups by:
- Priority (Urgent, High, Medium, Low)
- Due dates (Today, This Week, Overdue)
- Status (Pending, In Progress, Completed)

This ensures you tackle the most critical follow-ups first."

**[Action: Point to manual creation button]**

"While FizzTask automatically detects follow-ups, you can also manually create them for any conversation you want to track. Simply click 'Create Follow-up' and set your reminder date.

This hybrid approach - AI detection plus manual control - ensures nothing important gets forgotten."
