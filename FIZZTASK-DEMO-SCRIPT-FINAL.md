## ðŸŽ¬ OPENING (0:00 - 0:20)

**[Scene: FizzTask Logo Animation]**

**Narration:**
"Are you drowning in emails, losing track of important tasks, and missing critical deadlines? 

What if AI could automatically extract tasks from your emails AND documents, organizing everything in one intelligent system?

Welcome to FizzTask - your AI-powered productivity assistant. Let me show you how it works."

## ðŸ“Š SECTION 1: DASHBOARD OVERVIEW (0:20 - 0:50)

**[Scene: Dashboard showing actual metrics]**

**Narration:**
"The FizzTask dashboard gives you instant visibility into your workday. Right now, we can see:

- **20 active tasks** requiring attention
- **3 overdue tasks** highlighted with a warning - we never let deadlines slip by unnoticed
- **7 unread emails** in your inbox
- **2 follow-ups** to maintain

Notice the 'Due Today' section showing urgent items like 'Review and Sign Partnership Agreement' due at 9:05 PM. 

FizzTask keeps your most pressing tasks front and center, so you always know what needs immediate attention."

**[Action: Point to the overdue alert]**

"This alert ensures overdue tasks get addressed immediately."

## ðŸ“§ SECTION 2: EMAIL MANAGEMENT (0:50 - 1:40)

**[Scene: Navigate to Emails page showing actual emails]**

**Narration:**
"Now let's look at the Emails section. Here we have real business emails that need processing.

Look at this email from Emma Thompson about the Customer Portal Redesign project. Notice two powerful features:"

**[Action: Point to the blue buttons]**

"First, the 'Extract from Email' button - this uses AI to find tasks within the email body.

But here's where FizzTask really shines - see this attachment? The 'Extract Tasks from 1 Document' button can analyze attached files to find hidden action items."

**[Action: Point to the PDF attachment]**

"This Customer Portal Project Charter PDF contains 662KB of project information. FizzTask can process PDFs, Word documents, Excel files, and more to extract actionable tasks."

**[Action: Show the urgent email from Michael Chen]**

"Here's another example - an urgent client presentation request. FizzTask recognizes the urgency and can extract specific deliverables from both the email and any attached presentation files."

---

## âœ… SECTION 3: TASK MANAGEMENT (1:40 - 2:30)

**[Scene: Navigate to Tasks page]**

**Narration:**
"The Tasks page shows everything FizzTask has captured and organized. We currently have:

- **24 total tasks**
- **20 active tasks** 
- **3 overdue** items requiring immediate attention

Let's look at these extracted tasks:"

**[Action: Point to specific tasks]**

"Notice this task: 'Review all project statuses by Thursday EOD' - marked as urgent. It was extracted from the Weekly Status Report document.

Below that: 'Propose mitigation strategies (Due: Friday 2 PM)' - with medium priority.

What's important here is the source tracking - each task shows it was 'Extracted from: Weekly_Status_Report_Template.docx'. You always have complete context."

**[Action: Highlight the issue with "No due date"]**

"While FizzTask extracts the task content accurately, you can always edit and add specific due dates when the AI cannot determine exact timing from the source text."

---

## ðŸ“„ SECTION 4: DOCUMENT INTELLIGENCE (2:30 - 3:30)

**[Scene: Navigate to Documents page - Document History tab]**

**Narration:**
"The Documents hub is where FizzTask's AI truly shines. We've processed 4 documents with impressive results:

- **21 total tasks extracted**
- **89% average confidence score**
- **100% success rate**

Look at these results:"

**[Action: Point to specific documents]**

"The Weekly Status Report template yielded 18 tasks - that's 18 action items you might have missed by just reading the document!

The Q3 Budget Projections Excel file? 1 task extracted - likely a deadline or approval requirement hidden in the spreadsheet."

**[Action: Switch to Analytics tab]**

"In our analytics, you can see we support multiple file types:
- Excel files for spreadsheets and data
- PDFs for contracts and reports  
- Word documents for templates and memos

Each document type is processed intelligently to find deadlines, action items, and deliverables."

**[Note about PPT]**

"While PowerPoint files appear in our system, they currently need to be converted to PDF for task extraction - a simple extra step for presentation files."

---

## ðŸ”” SECTION 5: FOLLOW-UP MANAGEMENT (3:30 - 4:00)

**[Scene: Navigate to Follow-ups page]**

**Narration:**
"FizzTask helps you stay on top of important conversations with intelligent follow-up tracking.

We currently have 2 follow-ups:
- One due today 
- Another due in 3 days

These follow-ups ensure important emails don't get lost in your inbox. When you need to circle back on a conversation, FizzTask reminds you at the right time."

---

## ðŸŽ¯ CLOSING: THE FIZZTASK DIFFERENCE (4:00 - 4:30)

**[Scene: Return to Dashboard]**

**Narration:**

- **Automatic task extraction** from emails AND document attachments
- **Support for PDFs, Word, Excel, and text files** 
- **89% confidence** in task identification
- **Never miss a deadline** with overdue alerts
