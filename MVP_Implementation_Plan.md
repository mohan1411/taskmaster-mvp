# TaskMaster AI MVP - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the TaskMaster AI Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Given the cost constraints and single-developer approach, this plan focuses on creating a functional MVP that demonstrates the core value proposition of TaskMaster while maintaining feasibility for solo development.

## MVP Scope

The MVP will focus on delivering the most value-generating features of TaskMaster AI:

### Core Features for MVP

1. **Email Task Extraction**
   - Connect to Gmail API 
   - Extract tasks from email content using OpenAI API
   - Allow user review and approval of extracted tasks

2. **Basic Task Management**
   - Centralized dashboard for tasks
   - Simple prioritization system
   - Basic categorization

3. **Follow-up Tracking**
   - Track emails requiring responses
   - Send reminders for follow-ups
   - Basic follow-up management interface

4. **Simple Analytics**
   - Track number of tasks processed
   - Basic time-saving calculations
   - Simple productivity metrics

### Features Deferred for Post-MVP

1. Advanced integrations (beyond Gmail)
2. Complex AI customization
3. Team collaboration features
4. Mobile application (will use responsive web design instead)
5. Advanced analytics and reporting

## Technical Stack for MVP

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js
- **UI Library**: Material-UI
- **State Management**: React Context API + Hooks (no Redux for MVP)
- **Routing**: React Router

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM)
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with Google OAuth

### AI Integration
- **Natural Language Processing**: OpenAI API (GPT-4)
- **Email Integration**: Gmail API

### Deployment
- **Frontend Hosting**: Vercel or Netlify (both have free tiers)
- **Backend Hosting**: Render.com or Railway.app (affordable options)
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (free tier)

## Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Setup & Foundation
- Day 1-2: Project setup, repository structure, and development environment
- Day 3-4: Authentication and user management implementation
- Day 5-7: Gmail API integration and email fetching

### Week 2: Core Functionality
- Day 8-10: Task extraction with OpenAI API
- Day 11-12: Task management interface
- Day 13-14: Task storage and retrieval system

### Week 3: Enhanced Features
- Day 15-17: Follow-up detection and management
- Day 18-19: Basic dashboard implementation
- Day 20-21: Simple analytics tracking

### Week 4: Refinement & Launch
- Day 22-23: UI/UX refinement and testing
- Day 24-25: Bug fixes and performance optimization
- Day 26-28: Deployment and launch preparation

## Development Approach

### Solo Development Strategies

1. **Iterative Development**
   - Focus on one feature at a time
   - Get to a working state before moving to the next feature
   - Regular testing after each component is completed

2. **Use of Pre-built Components**
   - Leverage Material-UI components extensively
   - Use open-source libraries when possible
   - Minimize custom component development

3. **Simplified Architecture**
   - Keep the component structure flat when possible
   - Focus on maintainability over complex optimizations
   - Use sensible defaults for configurations

4. **Efficient AI Usage**
   - Batch AI requests when possible to reduce costs
   - Cache results where appropriate
   - Use lower-tier OpenAI models for development, higher tier for production

## Resource Requirements

### Developer Tools
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Git for version control
- Node.js development environment
- MongoDB Compass for database management

### API Keys and Services
- OpenAI API key
- Google Cloud Platform project with Gmail API enabled
- MongoDB Atlas account
- Deployment platform accounts (Vercel/Netlify and Render/Railway)

### Estimated Costs
- **OpenAI API**: ~$50/month (can be optimized based on usage)
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Free tier initially
- **Hosting**: Free to $15/month depending on traffic
- **Google Cloud Platform**: Free tier for development usage
- **Total Estimated Monthly Cost**: $50-70 for MVP stage

## Success Criteria

The MVP will be considered successful if it:

1. Successfully extracts tasks from emails with reasonable accuracy (>80%)
2. Provides a usable interface for task management and follow-up tracking
3. Delivers measurable time savings compared to manual task management
4. Operates within the defined cost constraints
5. Can be used by real users for daily task management
6. Has a clear path for future enhancements

## Next Steps
