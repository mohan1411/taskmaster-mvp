# ðŸ”„ Production Rollback Status

## Current Stable Production State
- **Railway Backend**: Rolled back to last working deployment (before landing page)
- **Vercel Frontend**: Rolled back to last working deployment (before landing page)
- **Landing Page**: Working separately at landing.fizztask.com
- **Main App**: Working at fizztask.com

## What Caused the Failures

### Railway Failure
- Adding `landing/` folder caused build conflicts
- Railway tried to build entire repository including landing files
- `.railwayignore` didn't properly exclude the landing folder

### Vercel Failure (Main App)
Possible causes:
- Changes to `vercel.json` might have affected the main app deployment
- Root `package.json` changes might have conflicted
- Build command modifications affected the frontend build
- Possible dependency conflicts

## Safe Deployment Strategy

### For Railway (Backend)
1. Create a separate branch without landing:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b railway-production
   git rm -rf landing/
   git rm -f vercel.json  # Remove root vercel.json
   git commit -m "Production branch for Railway"
   git push origin railway-production
   ```
   Then point Railway to deploy from `railway-production` branch

### For Vercel (Frontend)
1. Ensure the main app project has:
   - Root Directory: `frontend`
   - No conflicting vercel.json in root
   - Clear build settings

### For Landing Page
- Keep it as a separate Vercel project
- Deploy from `main` branch with Root Directory: `landing`

## Files That Might Be Causing Conflicts
- `/vercel.json` (root level)
- `/package.json` (root level modifications)
- `/railway.toml`
- `/.railwayignore`

## Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Three Separate Branches (Cleanest)
```
main branch          â†’ For development
railway-production   â†’ For Railway (no landing/)
vercel-production   â†’ For Vercel main app (clean config)
```

### Option 2: Use GitHub Actions
Create deployment pipelines that:
- Build specific folders
- Deploy to specific services
- Avoid conflicts

## Before Next Deployment
1. Test the build locally:
   ```bash
   # Test Railway build
   npm run railway-build
   
   # Test Vercel build
   cd frontend && npm run build
   ```

2. Check for conflicts:
   - No duplicate configuration files
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Each service only builds what it needs

## Recovery Plan
If deployments fail again:
1. Immediately rollback in both Railway and Vercel
2. Check build logs for specific errors
3. Test builds locally first
4. Consider separate repositories if conflicts persist
